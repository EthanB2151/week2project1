                    With a grand sense of adventure, Stinkmeaner turned his curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creation that established him as a truly great designer. His unique mind led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleep, sophisticated, and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Stinkmeaner look."

                    That look and his relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included athe world-renouned Stinkmeaner lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Monder Art in New York

                    Stinkmeaner achieved his monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue me? Can I make it better?
                </p>
                <p class="personal-quote">
                    "What's good, *bleep*?!"

                    He loved his work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and function. "The details are not details," said Stinkmeaner. "They make the product."
                </p>

                    His own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Stinkmeaner noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration," he said, "a kind of 30-year flash."

                    A design critic once said that this extraordinary man just "just wanted to make the world a better place." That he did. That also made it a lot more interesting.
